Keep it together
construction/gluing. Add connections to stop things blowing apart as they grow. Arrange protons and neutrons within atomic Nucleus?

Connection
Machines that convert some resources into others. Fuel for resource transport also needs to move, leading to interesting optimal transport paths.
previous ideas: phone tower arrangement with heightmap
see also: Keep it together

Collector
Pull resources in towards a point.

Modular
build something made of recursive levels. A CPU?

Isolation
electrical isolation ; wiring problems
keep an enemy isolated? Enemies buff as they get closer to each other?
resource collection/construction game if isolated from society (factorio style)
forge connections with neighbouring settlements through trade (could also work for connection)


Leave something behind



Nothing is permanent
play snake on a skill tree (possibly on a skill tree slowly scrolling leftwards)
One snake move between combat levels? Play snake continuously to buff a tower defense array?
Player is free to buff snake speed?

Salvage
previous ideas: chess where you play one turn then pass the board to somebody else

Split
nuclear fission?
cell division?
